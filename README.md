Adolescent Perceptions on the Importance of Contributing to Society: a longitudinal analysis derived from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development
# Abstract
The purpose of this study was to identify factors and ideals within adolescents’ lives that held a significant relationship with their perceptions of contributing to society. The study utilized longitudinal data collected through surveys as part of the 4-H Study on Positive Youth Development, conducted by the Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development at Tufts University. Three specific participant groups were used for this multinomial logistic regression study. Participants from waves one, four, and eight were selected for the models due to the cognitive development differences of adolescents. The results of the study indicated there were five statistically significant predictor variables that made up adolescents’ perceptions of the importance of contributing to society, as defined by the dependent variable, “It is important to contribute to society.” The five predictor variables identified the need for adolescent interaction with adults, the importance of understanding adolescent cognitive development, and the necessity of teaching adolescents social skills and emotional competence. The results indicated for an adolescent to understand the importance of contributing to society, society must first care for and educate the child
